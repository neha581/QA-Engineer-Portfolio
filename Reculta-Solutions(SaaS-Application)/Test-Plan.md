# **Test Plan: Reculta Solutions**

## **1. Introduction**
Reculta is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application designed to automate the campus placement process for educational institutions. The platform allows admins, recruiters, and students to manage and interact with placement-related activities efficiently. This test plan outlines the approach, scope, strategy, and resources required to verify the functional and performance aspects of the application.

---

## **2. Test Objectives**
The primary objectives of the testing process are:
- To ensure that all user roles (SPOC/Admin, Recruiter, Student) can perform their tasks as expected.
- To verify the functionality of key features, including user management, job postings, student applications, and CV management.
- To test the integration of various modules such as notifications, bulk upload, and reporting.
- To validate system performance under high load conditions.
- To identify any defects or issues in the application and ensure that they are resolved before deployment.
- **Automate Regression Test Cases:** Automate the execution of regression test cases to save time and reduce manual testing effort, ensuring that new changes or features do not break existing functionality. Automated tests will be executed in the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Selenium and Jenkins to further reduce time and costs in future test cycles.

## **3. Testing Scope**
### **In-Scope**
- **Functional Testing:**
  - User Management (Adding users individually and via bulk upload).
  - Job Management (Adding, editing, and viewing job postings).
  - Student Dashboard (Viewing jobs, applying, and creating multiple CVs).
  - Notifications and Reports (Job deadlines, status updates, and reports).

- **Regression Testing:**
  - Ensure that new updates or fixes don’t break existing functionality.

- **Cross-Browser Testing:**
  - Verify that the platform works across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

- **Security Testing:**
  - Check for role-based access control (RBAC) and user data security.

### **Out-of-Scope**
- Third-party integrations not directly linked to core functionalities.

---

## **4. Test Approach**
The approach to testing will be based on manual testing, supplemented with automated testing using Selenium for regression and repetitive test cases. Jenkins will be used for automating the execution of Selenium tests as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### **Test Levels**
1. **Unit Testing:** Conducted by the development team for individual components.
2. **Integration Testing:** Focus on testing the integration between modules like User Management, Job Management, and Student Applications.
3. **System Testing:** End-to-end functional testing of the complete application.
4. **Acceptance Testing:** Verifying the system against the requirements to ensure that the application is ready for deployment.

## **5. Test Deliverables**
- **Test Plan** – This document.
- **Test Cases** – A list of all test cases for functional, performance, and integration testing.
- **Test Data** – Input data required for executing test cases.
- **Test Logs** – Logs for each executed test case.
- **Bug Reports** – Details of any bugs found during the testing process.
- **Test Summary Report** – A summary report of the testing activities, outcomes, and defect statistics.

---

### **Tools & Technologies**
- **Manual Testing Tools:** Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), Postman (for API testing), SQL tools for database validation.
- **Automation Tools:** Selenium WebDriver, Jenkins (for CI/CD automation), Maven for managing test dependencies.
- **Bug Tracking:** JIRA to track issues and defects.
- **Version Control:** Git for managing test scripts and code.

## **7. Test Schedule**
The test execution will follow the following schedule:

| **Phase**                | **Duration**         | **Start Date** | **End Date** |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Test Planning**         | 2 Days               | 2019-12-26     | 2019-12-28   |
| **Test Case Development** | 5 Days               | 2019-12-29     | 2019-01-02   |
| **Test Execution**        | 7 Days               | 2019-01-03     | 2019-01-10   |
| **Bug Fixing & Retesting**| 4 Days               | 2019-01-11     | 2019-01-14   |
| **Final Report**          | 2 Days               | 2019-01-15     | 2019-01-16   |

## **8. Risk Management**
### **Potential Risks:**
- **Incomplete Test Cases:** Some edge cases or functionalities may be overlooked.
- **Delay in Bug Fixing:** Developers might not resolve defects within the planned time.
- **High Load Impact:** Performance degradation during high traffic events may lead to slow application response.

### **Mitigation Plan:**
- Collaborate with developers to identify and test edge cases.
- Use Jenkins to run automated tests frequently and identify issues early.
- Perform stress testing and monitor performance during peak usage.

---

## **9. Test Environment**
The test environment will be a replica of the production environment with the following specifications:

- **Frontend:** Web application running on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- **Backend:** The SaaS application will be hosted on cloud infrastructure (AWS).
- **Database:** MySQL for storing user and job data.
- **API:** REST APIs exposed for job and user management.

---

## **10. Entry and Exit Criteria**

### **Entry Criteria**
- The application has passed the development phase.
- All required features and functionalities are implemented.
- Test cases are developed and reviewed.

### **Exit Criteria**
- All test cases have been executed and results documented.
- All critical and major defects have been resolved or deferred.
- The system has passed performance testing under high load.
