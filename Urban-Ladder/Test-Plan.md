# Test Plan for Urban Ladder Storefront Testing

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the reliability, functionality, and performance of the Urban Ladder Storefront and inventory management portal. The focus is on verifying key functionalities, synchronization between the backend and frontend, and cross-platform compatibility.

---

## 2. Objectives

1. Validate the **Storefront Functionality**:
   - Adding, updating, and removing individual and bulk products.
   - Verifying accurate display of product details (images, descriptions, pricing, offers, and availability).

2. Ensure **Data Synchronization**:
   - Confirm seamless synchronization between the inventory management portal and the e-commerce website.
   - Verify the integrity of updates across web pages, APIs, and databases.

3. Perform **Web and API Testing**:
   - Validate API endpoints used for product-related actions (CRUD operations).
   - Test web interface workflows for product management.

4. Assess **Cross-Browser and Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - Ensure functionality across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
   - Validate responsiveness and usability on platforms (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- Functional Testing:
  - User workflows: Add, update, delete products (individual and bulk).
  - Verification of UI/UX elements.
  
- API Testing:
  - Endpoints for product data actions.
  
- Database Validation:
  - Checking product data consistency in backend databases.
  
- Cross-Browser/Platform Testing:
  - Ensuring consistent experience on targeted platforms and browsers.

- Performance Testing:
  - Simulating bulk product uploads under high traffic conditions.
  
### Out of Scope
- Third-party integrations not related to product inventory management.
- Testing features beyond the storefront and inventory portal.

## 4. Testing Approach

### 4.1 Functional Testing
- Test user workflows, focusing on edge cases like invalid SKUs or session timeouts.
- Validate data display on storefront for accuracy.

### 4.2 API Testing
- Test API endpoints for CRUD operations using Postman.
- Validate responses, error handling, and performance under high load.

### 4.3 Cross-Browser/Platform Testing
- Use tools like BrowserStack or manually test on supported browsers and devices.

### 4.4 Performance Testing
- Simulate bulk product uploads and measure synchronization latency.
- Test under scenarios like sales events to ensure robustness.

### 4.5 Regression Testing
- Automate frequently run test cases using Selenium.
