# Overview

- Urban Ladder is a premium furniture platform that provides customers with an extensive range of furniture and home decor products. The platform offers seamless e-commerce functionalities, including browsing, purchasing, and managing furniture items. 
- My focus is on ensuring the reliability and functionality of the **storefront**, the inventory management portal used to upload product details, including images, descriptions, pricing, offers, and availability, ensuring seamless synchronization between the portal and the Ecomm website.
