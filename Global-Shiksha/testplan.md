# **Test Plan for Payment Gateway**

---

## **1. Introduction**  
The purpose of this test plan is to verify the functionality, performance, security, and reliability of the **Payment Gateway Integration** for the **Global Shiksha Platform**. This integration allows users to process payments through various methods (credit card, debit card, UPI, net banking, etc.).  

The goal is to ensure a seamless, secure, and error-free payment process to enhance user experience.

---

## **2. Scope**  
The scope of this test plan includes the following:  
- **Functional Testing**: Verify all functional flows for payments (successful, failed, refunded).  
- **API Testing**: Ensure accuracy and reliability of API responses.  
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between the Payment Gateway and the Global Shiksha backend.  

**Out of Scope**:  
- Payment flows outside the supported payment gateway.  
- Third-party systems unrelated to payment processing.  

---

## **3. Objectives**  
The key objectives of the test plan are:  
1. Verify end-to-end payment transactions for **success**, **failure**, **refund**, and **timeout** scenarios.  
2. Ensure accurate and compliant API responses.
3. Ensure payment gateway integration works seamlessly across platforms (web and mobile).
